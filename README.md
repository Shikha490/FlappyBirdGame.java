# FlappyBirdGame.java
In Flappy Bird, the player controls a bird that automatically moves forward through a series of obstacles (pipes). The goal is to navigate the bird through gaps in the pipes by tapping the screen (or pressing a key) to make the bird flap and gain altitude. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
